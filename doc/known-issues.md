- AltDrag has some issues with high-DPI displays, [read here for a workaround](https://github.com/stefansundin/altdrag/issues/7#issuecomment-50701359). As I do not have a high-DPI display, I don't know when I will be able to fix this.
- If AltDrag for some reason malfunctions, you can always hit the Esc key to tell it to stop doing whatever it is doing.
- There are other known issues, [see here](usage.html#known-issues).
- Take a look at the [list of issues on GitHub]({{ site.github.issues_url }}).
